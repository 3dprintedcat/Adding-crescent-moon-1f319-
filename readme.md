# Rebble Emojis

This repo contains emoji bitmaps created by members of the Rebble community

These will be used in RebbleOS, or potentially a language pack for PebbleOS

Each emoji has a small version (roughly 11x11px) and a large version (rougly 18x18px) and should be in png format.

The image filename should follow the format pebble-emoji-`Emoji Name`-`sizecode`-`dimensions`.png
sizecode is `sm` for small, `lg` for large. So for example the large star emoji file with a size of 18x18px would be called `pebble-emoji-start-lg-18x18.png`
