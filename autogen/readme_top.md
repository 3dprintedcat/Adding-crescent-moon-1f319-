# Rebble Emojis

This repo contains emoji bitmaps created by members of the Rebble community

These will be used in RebbleOS, or potentially a language pack for PebbleOS.

Emoji files are in emojis/

All other folders are to do with the auto-generating readme file.

# Contributing

To contribute create a small and large png file with the emoji, with a filename that follows the convention detailed below.    

Before you open a PR, consider viewing the emoji's thread in \#mobile-apps on the [Rebble discord server](https://rebble.io/discord).   

Each emoji has a small version (roughly 11x11px) and a large version (rougly 18x18px) and should be in png format.   

The image filename should follow the format '`codepoint`-`sizecode`.png'   

sizecode is `sm` for small, `lg` for large.   
For example the large [star emoji](https://emojipedia.org/star/) file would be called `2B50-lg.png`
